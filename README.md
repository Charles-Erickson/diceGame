## Usage
This is a twist on the classic game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors." Two players vie to get the best of five games, the twist? 
Each has a limited and random amount of 'cards' (or times they can play an action).
Players will roll 2 dice for each value of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Dice range from 3 to 7 and each is meant to be used only once by either player.
The amount of each players' hand will be displayed in the console.log.
Once the game begins players will follow the prompts to play rounds of R,P,S.
Wins will appear in the console.log
The player with the most logged wins will be victorious
